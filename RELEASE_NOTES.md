# Release Notes

This document tracks all releases of the Threshold application.

---

## Version 0.1.9

**Release Date:** March 2, 2026
**Status:** Released

> [!NOTE]
> This release delivers a full alarm ringing experience on Wear OS, cross-device dismiss and snooze coordination, and a ground-up rewrite of the release TUI using Ink.

### ✨ New Features

**Wear OS Ringing Screen**

- Full-screen Compose ringing UI with Material You gradient, breathing ring animations, and threshold indicator
- Foreground service with vibration, alarm audio via MediaPlayer, and partial wake lock
- Bidirectional control: dismissing or snoozing on either device dismisses both via event bus routing
- Disconnected fallback scheduling: watch fires alarms independently via local `AlarmManager.setAlarmClock()` when phone is out of Bluetooth range
- Offline fallback reconciliation for repeating alarms while connectivity remains unavailable
- Snooze duration sync from phone settings to watch persistence via DataItem payload
- Ring deduplication to prevent duplicate ringing when multiple messages arrive
- "Test Watch Ring" button in phone settings and "Test Ring" in watch settings
- Three design iteration mockups (soft-glow, Material+Liminal, standard buttons)

**Cross-Device Ringing Coordination**

- Phone ringing screen closes when watch stops or snoozes the active alarm
- Guard against duplicate close attempts when local actions and backend events race

**Unified Release TUI**

- Replaced the monolithic `update-release-version.mjs` (1,400+ lines) with a screen-based Ink (React for CLI) TUI in `tools/release-tui/`
- Full-screen alternate-screen mode with reactive terminal resize, pinned footer, and single-key hotkeys
- 10 screens: Version Bump, Custom Version, Review, Tag Conflict, Build Offer, Build Progress, Pre-flight Failure, Done, Release Log, and Help
- CI/non-interactive mode via `--ci` flags with `--bump`, `--redo`, `--build`, `--dry-run`, `--no-commit`, `--no-web-sync`
- Detailed specification document and 10 SVG screen mockups

### 🐛 Bug Fixes

- Fixed phone ringing UI not closing when watch dismisses or snoozes the alarm
- Fixed native alarm replay hydration: initialise Rust time-format and snooze state before marking alarm pipeline ready
- Fixed offline fallback reconciliation so repeating fallback alarms continue scheduling
- Fixed watch ringing action labels and time bloom presentation
- Fixed watch 24-hour fallback when phone time format is unknown
- Fixed ringing task reopening via watch recents
- Fixed phone and watch alarm stop/snooze state synchronisation
- Fixed phone ringing route alarms not reporting as fired for wear sync
- Resolved CI failures in Rust tests and Mermaid lint warnings
- Fixed release TUI reactive terminal resize and detail panel divider width
- Fixed release TUI repo root detection when invoked from a subpackage

### 🛠️ Build and Release

- Added tag-driven signed release build workflow for GitHub Actions
- Refreshed GitHub Actions versions across existing workflows
- Documented release build pipeline and signing setup
- Added commander CLI parsing to release TUI
- Added `tools/*` to `pnpm-workspace.yaml` and wired `pnpm version:release` to the new TUI
